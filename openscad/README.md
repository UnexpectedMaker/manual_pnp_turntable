# Openscad designs for Manual PnP Turntable V3

This is parametric design for Manual PnP Turntable V3 with openscad files that should be easy to modify for various parameters (bearing height, diameter, parts thickness etc). 
As it is it should be fully compatible and other designs unless I made some mistakes.

# Diffeerences from original design

- turntable_base_7mm.stl 
 
New base for bearing 6805-ZZ 25x37x7mm which is cheaper on Amazon on US than original but it 1mm thicker. All other parts remain the same.

I do not like to loose a lot material for support so I created different design for parts tray. It consists of 2 parts A and B and they are glued together. 
Part B has 2 variants - with hole for bearing access and without one. Print only one part B you prefer. Part A stays the same.

- turntable_parts_tray_partA.stl
- turntable_parts_tray_partB_hole.stl
- rntable_parts_tray_partB_nohole.stl

Note: if you use 2 parts part tray there is a bonus: you can use part B to cut rubber and you do not need top print turntable_V3_rubber_cutter.stl

Enjoy.
